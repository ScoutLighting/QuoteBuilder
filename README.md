## Make something:
I would clone, not fork, this repo in case there are updates down the road.
#### To clone this repo onto your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/sarahdherr/hotplate.git
cd hotplate
git remote rename origin hotplate
```
This will clone the repo to your machine and rename the remote repo to hotplate. Now when you want to get the most up-to-date of this repo, use `git pull hotplate master`.

#### To add your own remote repo, do the following commands:
```
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
git remote add origin https://github.com/{YOUR USER NAME}/{YOUR REPO NAME}.git
git push -u origin master
```

#### To start the repo, run the following commands in your terminal:
```
npm install
npm start
```
