## Make something:
I would clone, not fork, this repo in case there are updates down the road. To clone this repo onto your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/sarahdherr/hotplate.git
git remote rename origin hotplate
```
This will clone the repo to your machine and rename the remote repo to hotplate. Now when you want to get the most up-to-date of this repo, use `git pull hotplate master`.
